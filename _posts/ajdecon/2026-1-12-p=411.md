<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/buttplug.engineer/post/3mc6qyarp2c2m">Some discussion on bsky</a> of the usefulness of Tailscale, and I’ll just note here how very handy it is for running a personal homelab that includes cloud instances. As well as just having lab connectivity from a laptop or phone on the go!</p>




<p>Services I run over Tailscale, just for myself, include:</p>




<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An RSS feed reader</li>



<li>A personal git forge</li>



<li>An IRC bouncer</li>



<li>A (poorly maintained) wiki</li>



<li>JupyterLab</li>



<li>Open WebUI for playing with local LLMs on a GPU workstation</li>



<li>SSH to a powerful workstation, hosted at home but without complex configs</li>
</ul>



<p>And probably a few things I’ve forgotten! It’s really just very neat. Sure I could do it all with manual Wireguard configs. But Tailscale just makes the underlying primitive much more ergonomic.</p>
