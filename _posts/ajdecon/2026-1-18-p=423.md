<p>Because when the people training these models justify why they&#8217;re worth it, they appeal to pretty extreme outcomes. When Dario Amodei wrote his essay&nbsp;<a href="https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace">Machines of Loving Grace</a>, he wrote that he sees the benefits as being extraordinary: &#8220;Reliable prevention and treatment of nearly all natural infectious disease &#8230; Elimination of most cancer &#8230; Prevention of Alzheimer’s &#8230; Improved treatment of most other ailments &#8230; Doubling of the human lifespan.&#8221; These are the benefits that the CEO of Anthropic uses to justify his belief that LLMs are worth it. If you think that these risks sound fanciful, then I might encourage you to consider what benefits you see LLMs as bringing, and then consider if you think the risks&nbsp;are worth it.</p>

<p>From Carlini’s recent talk/article on <em><a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2025/are-llms-worth-it.html">Are large language models worth it?</a></em></p>




<p>The entire article is well worth reading, but I was struck by this bit near the end. LLM researchers often dismiss (some of) the risks of these models as fanciful. But many of the benefits touted by the labs sound just as fanciful!</p>




<p>When we’re evaluating the worth of this research, it’s a good idea to be consistent about how realistic — or how “galaxy brain” — you want to be, with both risks and benefits.</p>
