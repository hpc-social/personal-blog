<p>In this installment of the Surfing the Singularity blog we go vlog, giving an overview of quantum computing today with application to chemistry. Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, with improvements in machine size, error correction, and scalability. And yet, there's always a desire to drive towards advancements and scientific applications which are just out of reach of today's technologies. New algorithms lead the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this video, will give a brief overview of quantum computing, what it means, where we are on the product roadmaps, and explore an emergent algorithm for pushing the boundaries of chemical modeling beyond what is possible with today's classical machines. Enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
