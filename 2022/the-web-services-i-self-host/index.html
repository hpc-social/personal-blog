	<h1>The web services I self-host</h1>
	<h2>Why self-host anything?</h2>

<p>In a lot of ways, self-hosting web services is signing up for extra pain. Most useful web services are available in SaaS format these days, and most people don&#8217;t want to be a sysadmin just to use chat, email, or read the news.</p>

<p>In general, I decide to self-host a service if one of two things is true:</p>

<p><span id="more-235"></span></p>

<ul><li>Self-hosting is going to add a capability that&#8217;s difficult to find in a SaaS alternative. That might be privacy, or extra compute, or just an extra degree of customization that I want.<br /></li><li>I find it interesting or amusing to self-host it! I <em>have been</em> a professional sysadmin, and ran production web services for over a decade. So I enjoy messing around with servers, and can have a fair amount of fun with this.</li></ul>

<h2>Infrastructure and general tooling</h2>

<p>Right now my self-hosted services are hosted on <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</a>, for a very simple reason: OCI includes a <em>very</em> generous <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/">Always Free tier</a>, which doesn&#8217;t even ask for a credit card! So I&#8217;m confident I&#8217;m not going to accidentally spend any money. I use ARM Ampere A1 Compute instances for service hosting.</p>

<p>The individual services are mostly managed using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker Compose files</a>, though a few are just running bare-metal. I have so far managed to resist the urge to put everything in Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Everything is backed up on a regular basis using <a href="https://www.tarsnap.com/">Tarsnap</a>.</p>

<p>I also use <a href="https://tailscale.com/">Tailscale</a> to provide a VPN between my cloud servers and my various client devices (phone, laptop, tablet). If a service needs to be exposed to the public Internet to function, I do that&#8230; but otherwise, everything is only exposed within the Tailscale VPN, so that only my own devices can access them. This is both a lovely convenience (not having to manage as many DNS records), and provides an extra degree of security by hiding services that no one else needs to access.</p>

<h2>Services that I self-host</h2>

<ul><li><strong>RSS reader: </strong>Despite the demise of Google Reader back in the mists of time, I&#8217;ve been a consistently heavy user of RSS feed since at least 2008. At times I&#8217;ve used commercial products such as <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>, but these days I self-host the aggregator using <a href="https://freshrss.org/">FreshRSS</a>. I use FreshRSS partly because it&#8217;s pretty easy to spin up and administer, and partly because it&#8217;s compatible with <a href="https://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>, a Mac and iOS app that I generally use to actually read my feeds.<br /></li><li><strong>Fediverse instance: </strong>I run a <a href="https://calico.social/">self-hosted instance</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a> ensemble of social networking sites. The best-known tool for this is <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, but I currently use the <a href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma server</a>, mostly because it seemed less painful to set up and configure. I run my own instance partly out of curiosity, and partly because I didn&#8217;t strongly resonate with any particular topic-specific server that&#8217;s already out there.<br /></li><li><strong>IRC bouncer: </strong>I&#8217;m not on IRC very much these days, but I do like to avoid losing messages, and sometimes want to be logged into the same channels on different physical clients. So I run a <a href="https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC">ZNC</a> server to maintain persistence.<br /></li><li><strong>Matrix server: </strong><a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> is a decentralized messaging platform that supports end-to-end encryption. Think of it as being a little like the Fediverse, but for chat rather than microblogging. This falls pretty squarely in the category of &#8220;I find this amusing to run&#8221;, because I mostly chat with less-nerdy folks on other, commercial platforms.<br /></li><li><strong>Git server: </strong>I run a <a href="https://gitea.io/en-us/">Gitea</a> server which I use to mirror my own repos, as well as a variety of other open source repos. This is mostly to ensure that I have an up-to-date backup of repos I care about, independent of Github or whatever provider.<br /></li><li><strong>Jupyter notebooks: </strong>I keep a persistent <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebook instance running for random code experiments and as a tiny development playground. This runs on its own VM where I also do other random software development, and it&#8217;s separate from the other services mostly so I don&#8217;t take down all my personal infra with an accidental OOM from a big build.<br /></li><li><strong>Software package repository: </strong>I run an instance of <a href="https://www.sonatype.com/products/repository-oss-download">Nexus Repository OSS</a>, mostly to cache Docker images and other content that run the rest of the services above!</li></ul>

<h2>Services where I use managed hosting but don&#8217;t own the server</h2>

<ul><li><strong>This website!</strong> My <a href="https://www.ajdecon.org">regular website</a> and this blog run on a shared hosting provider, mostly through inertia. (I&#8217;ve used the same hosting provider for web hosting since around 2008.)<br /></li><li><strong>Email: </strong>In theory it&#8217;s an open, federated system similar to the Fediverse. In practice, the combination of spam and the growth of large providers makes it increasingly painful to run a server yourself. This <a href="https://cfenollosa.com/blog/after-self-hosting-my-email-for-twenty-three-years-i-have-thrown-in-the-towel-the-oligopoly-has-won.html">post from Carlos Fenollosa</a> does a good job of describing the difficulties.<br /><br />I do, however, run all my email through my own domain, though it&#8217;s hosted via <s>Google Apps</s> <s>GSuite</s> Google Workspace. I also back up my inbox locally on a regular basis. That means that if Google ever decides to remove my account, charge obnoxious costs, or otherwise misbehave, my email address is at least portable to other providers.</li></ul>
